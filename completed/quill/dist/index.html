  "title": "Quill: community-driven with some limitations",
  "overview": "Quill is a widely-used rich text editor that has been in the market for several years, offering cross-platform support and a variety of features. While it provides essential functionalities like image upload, the editor's reliance on community-driven plugins and its out-of-the-box styling can present challenges for certain use cases.",
  "advantages": [
    "Supports image upload functionality",
    "Strong emphasis on cross-platform compatibility",
    "Established and widely used for many years"
  ],
  "drawbacks": [
    "More complex API with smaller documentation compared to alternatives like TipTap",
    "Includes built-in styling, making it less \"headless\" than some other editors",
    "Migrating existing content may be a cumbersome process"
  ],
  "conclusion": "Quill is a solid choice for developers looking for a feature-rich editor with good cross-platform support. However, its reliance on community plugins, more complex API, and built-in styling might limit its appeal for projects requiring a more lightweight or customizable solution."
