  "title": "Editor.js: suitable for basic use but limited for customization",

  "advantages": [
    "Satisfies basic functionality requirements effectively.",

    "Supports a wide range of block types, including text, images, and lists.",
    "Offers a wide range of plugins for additional functionality.",
    "Provides a flexible API for customizing the editor."
  ],
  "drawbacks": [
    "Customizing the user interface to meet specific client requirements proved difficult and unreliable.",
    "The lack of React-based architecture limits its compatibility and flexibility in certain development environments.",
    "Controlling keyboard event handlers posed significant challenges, reducing ease of integration."
