  "title": "Editor.js: suitable for basic use but limited for customization",
  "overview": "Editor.js provides essential functionality for creating and managing rich text content, making it a solid choice for simple applications. However, users seeking extensive customization or advanced features may find it less accommodating due to its block-based structure and limited UI flexibility.",
  "advantages": [
    "Meets basic rich text editing needs effectively.",
    "Easy to integrate for simple use cases.",
    "Supports a wide range of block types, including text, images, and lists.",
    "Offers a wide range of plugins for additional functionality.",
    "Provides a flexible API for customizing the editor."
  ],
  "drawbacks": [
    "UI customization for specific client needs was challenging and unreliable, for example, adjusting the block-based layoutâ€™s margins.",
    "The lack of React-based architecture limits its compatibility and flexibility in certain development environments.",
    "Controlling keyboard event handlers posed significant challenges, reducing ease of integration."
  ],
  "conclusion": "While Editor.js performs well for basic needs, it struggles to deliver the flexibility and reliability required for more extensive customizations or larger-scale projects. Developers should consider these limitations when choosing the tool for their specific needs."
